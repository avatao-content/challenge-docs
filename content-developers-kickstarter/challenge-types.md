# Challenge types

**1. Tutorial** \(created in TFW\): the user is guided through the challenge, supported with hints and other ways sed on the comprehensive messaging system of the TFW. This is the most frequently type of challenge used on the Avatao platform now.   
See example on the platform:[ Unsafe use of Reflection: Animal Fan Site](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/aabad73c-6eb0-4bd2-b7aa-ac351ad0ab96).  


2. **Attack**: the user has to capture the flag. This type of challenge has a simpler file structure. On the platform there’s a box where the flag should be written to check the solution.   
Example:[ Direct object reference](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/c51b9e30-773d-4987-87a9-48483e9fd3df).  


3. **Fixing**: the user has to complete unfinished code. In the beginning, these challenges were written with the Codiac framework, but we’re working on recreating  them in TFW, as quickly as possible.   
Examples:[ Fix insecure direct object reference \(with Codiad\)](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/7184be09-e318-4baf-b29a-432974ea9a6b),[ Fix Direct Object Reference with Spring AOP \(with TFW\)](https://platform.avatao.com/challenges/157fcb51-496e-47b1-9908-335b7a16c606).

4. **Assessment**: we’re planning on introducing a new type of challenge in the near future, meant to estimate the skills and basic knowledge of a user in different areas of IT security. The challenge will contain about ten questions with a time limit at each level.
