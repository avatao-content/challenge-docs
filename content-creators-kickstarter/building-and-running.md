# Building and running

We've prepared two scripts for locally building and running the exercises, you can find them in the [Challenge Toolbox](https://github.com/avatao-content/challenge-toolbox) repository.

The two scripts are `build.py` and `start.py`. Usage example:
* `./build.py <path to an exercise repository>`
* `./start.py <path to an exercise repository>`

There is a very useful script in the `challenge-toolbox` repo to purge your environment from the useless files of Docker, so if your disk starts to run out of space, run the `docker-cleanup.sh` script.
