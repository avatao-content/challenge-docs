# Exercise types

 1. **Tutorial** \(created using the TFW\): the user is guided through the exercise, that usually consists of a break-it and then a fix-it part. The users are supported with hints and other ways based on the comprehensive messaging system of the TFW. This is the most frequently used type of exercise on the Avatao platform now. E.g.: [Tutorial Framework](https://next.avatao.com/events/getting-started-with-avatao/challenges/tutorial-framework/description)

 2. **Attack**: the user has to capture the flag. The flag is submitted on the Avatao platform. This type of exercise has a simpler file structure, you can find examples in the template folder of the [Challenge Toolbox](https://github.com/avatao-content/challenge-toolbox/tree/v3/templates). E.g.: [Getting Started](https://next.avatao.com/events/getting-started-with-avatao/challenges/getting-started/description)
