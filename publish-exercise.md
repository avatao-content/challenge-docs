  It's really great if you create a exercise that runs locally, but the best
  thing is if you share it with others. To do so, you need to be an Avatao
  exercise creator. Let's see how.

# Publish your exercise on Avatao

At Avatao, we believe that there are many smart people around the world whose technical skills are invaluable, and theyâ€™re also happy to share their experience with others. That's why we do our best to make the process of content creation and publication as easy as possible. At the same time, we understand that the learning process must be fun and enjoyable. To achieve this, our content has to meet high quality standards.

{% hint style="info" %}
In short, each exercise or tutorial has to pass the automatic and manual review process, before being published.
{% endhint %}
